Welcome to our open source project!

We are committed to creating a friendly, respectful, and inclusive community.

## Our Pledge

As participants, contributors, and maintainers of our community, we pledge to:
- Treat everyone with openness, inclusivity, and collaboration;
- Respect individuals with different backgrounds and viewpoints, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, age, or any other factor;
- Focus on contributing and improving the project, rather than attacking or criticizing individuals;
- Build trust with community members and promote our project through constructive feedback;
- Provide a safe, supportive, and encouraging environment for community members to promote learning and personal growth.

## Our standards

Our community members should adhere to the following standards:
- Respect the opinions, viewpoints, and experiences of others;
- Avoid using insulting, discriminatory, or harmful language;
- Do not harass, intimidate, or threaten others;
- Do not publicly or privately disclose others' private information, such as contact information or addresses;
- Respect the privacy of others;
- Establish a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for community members.

## Our responsibility

Project maintainers have a responsibility to create a friendly, respectful, and inclusive environment for our community members.
They should:
- Clearly and publicly explain the community guidelines;
- Handle reports of guideline violations and resolve disputes appropriately;
- Protect the privacy and security of all community members;
- Maintain a fair, transparent, and responsible attitude.


## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub, mailing lists, forums, social media, gatherings, and conferences.
Violations of the code of conduct will be dealt with, including but not limited to warnings, temporary or permanent bans, revocation of contribution rights, and revocation of project access rights.

## Implementation guidelines

If you encounter behavior that violates this code of conduct, you can:
- Communicate privately with the relevant person to try to resolve the issue;
- Report the violation to the project maintainers(maintainer mailing list), who will take necessary action based on the situation;
- If you are not satisfied with the way the maintainers handle the situation, you can seek help from higher-level organizations or institutions.

Our community is a diverse, open, and inclusive community, and we welcome everyone's participation and contribution.
We believe that only in a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment can we create the best project together.
