tRPC-Go, as the [Go][] language implementation of [tRPC][], is a battle-tested microservices framework that has been extensively validated in production environments. It not only delivers high performance but also offers ease of use and testability.

For more information, please refer to the [quick start guide][quick start] and [detailed documentation][docs].

## Overall Architecture

![Architecture](.resources/overall.png)

tRPC-Go has the following features:

- Multiple services can be started within a single process, listening on multiple addresses.
- All components are pluggable, with default implementations for various basic functionalities that can be replaced. Other components can be implemented by third parties and registered within the framework.
- All interfaces can be mock tested using gomock&mockgen to generate mock code, facilitating testing.
- The framework supports any third-party protocol by implementing the `codec` interfaces for the respective protocol. It defaults to supporting trpc and http protocols and can be switched at any time.
- It provides the [trpc command-line tool][trpc-cmdline] for generating code templates.
