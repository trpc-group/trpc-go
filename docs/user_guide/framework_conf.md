# tRPC-Go Framework Configuration

## Introduction

The tRPC-Go framework configuration is a configuration file defined by the framework and used for framework initialization. The core of the tRPC framework adopts a plug-in architecture, which components all core functions, and connects all component functions in series through the interface-based programming thinking. Each component is associated with the plug-in SDK through configuration. The tRPC framework provides the `trpc_go.yaml` framework configuration file by default, which gathers the configuration of all basic components into the framework configuration file and passes it to the components when the service starts. In this way, each components don't have to manage their own configuration independently.

Through the introduction of this article, I hope to help users understand the following:
- Components of framework configuration
- How to obtain the implication, value range, and default value of configuration parameters
- How to generate and manage configuration files
- How to use the framework configuration, whether it can be configured dynamically

## How To Use

First of all, the tRPC-Go framework does not support the dynamic update of the framework configuration. After modifying the framework configuration, the user needs to **restart the service** to take effect. There are three ways to set the frame configuration.

### Use Configuration File

**Recommended approach** This method use the framework configuration file. When `trpc.NewServer()` starts, it will first parse the framework configuration file, automatically initialize all configured plug-ins, and start the service. It is recommended that other initialization logic be placed after `trpc.NewServer()` to ensure that the framework functions have been initialized. The default framework configuration file name of tRPC-Go is `trpc_go.yaml`, and the default path is the working path of the current program startup. The configuration path can be specified by the `-conf` command line parameter.

```go
// Initialize tRPC service by using the framework configuration file.
func NewServer(opt ...server.Option) *server.Server
```

### Build Configuration Data

**Not recommended approach** This method does not require a framework configuration file, but user needs to assemble the startup parameter `*trpc.Config` by himself. The disadvantage of using this method is that the flexibility of configuration changes is poor. Any configuration modification requires code changes, and the decoupling of configuration and program code cannot be achieved.

```go
// User builds cfg framework configuration data, and initialize tRPC service.
func NewServerWithConfig(cfg *Config, opt ...server.Option) *server.Server;
```

### Modify Configuration with Option

Both of these methods provide `Option` parameters to change local parameters. `Option` configuration takes precedence over framework configuration file configuration and `Config` configuration data. An example of using `Option` to modify the framework configuration is as follows.

```go
import (
    "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-go"
    server "trpc.group/trpc-go/trpc-go/server"
)
func main() {
    s := trpc.NewServer(server.WithEnvName("test"), server.WithAddress("127.0.0.1:8001"))
    //...
}
```

> In the rest of this article, we will only discuss the framework configuration file pattern.


## Configuration Design

### The Overall Structure

The framework configuration file design is mainly divided into four groups.

| Group | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| global | The global configuration defines general configurations such as environment-related. |
| server | The server configuration defines the general configuration of the program as a server, including application name, program name, configuration path, interceptor list, `Naming Service` list, etc. |
| client | The client configuration defines the general configuration of the program as a client, including interceptor list, the configuration of the `Naming Service` list to be accessed, etc. It is recommended to use the configuration center first for client configuration, and then the `client` configuration in the framework configuration file. |
| plugins | The plugin configuration collects all the configurations that use plugins. Since `plugins` use a `map` to manage out of order, the framework will randomly pass the plugin configurations to the SDK one by one at startup, and start the plugins. The plugin configuration format is determined by the plugin itself. |

## Create Configuration

We have introduced that the startup of the program initializes the framework by reading the framework configuration file. So how to generate framework configuration file? This section introduces the following three common methods.

### Create Configurations through Tools

The framework configuration file can be automatically generated by [trpc-cmdline](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-cmdline) tool. The services defined in the PB file are automatically added to the configuration file. 

```shell
# generate the stub code and the framework configuration file "trpc_go.yaml" through PB file
trpc create -p helloworld.proto
```

It should be emphasized that the configuration generated by the tool is only a template configuration, and users need to modify the configuration content according to their own needs.

### Create Configurations through the Operation Platform

For large complex systems, the best practice is to manage the framework configuration files uniformly through the service operation platform, and the platform will generate the framework configuration files uniformly and deliver them to the machines where the program will run.

### Use Environment Variables to Substitute the Configurations

tRPC-Go also provides the golang template to generate framework configuration: it supports automatic replacement of framework configuration placeholders by reading environment variables. Create a configuration file template through tools or operating platforms, and then replace the environment variable placeholders in the configuration file with environment variables.

For the use of environment variables, first use `${var}` to represent variable parameters in the configuration file, such as:

```yaml
server:
  app: ${app}
  server: ${server}
  service: 
    - name: trpc.test.helloworld.Greeter
      ip: ${ip}
      port: ${port}
```

When the framework starts, it will first read the text content of the configuration file `trpc_go.yaml`. When the placeholder is recognized, the framework will automatically read the corresponding value from the environment variable.

As shown in the above configuration content, the environment variables need to be pre-set with the following data:

```shell
export app=test
export server=helloworld
export ip=1.1.1.1
export port=8888
```

Since the framework configuration will parse the `$` symbol, when configuring the user, do not include the `$` character except for placeholders, such as passwords such as redis/mysql, do not include `$`.
