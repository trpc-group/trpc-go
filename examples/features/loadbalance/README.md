## Loadbalance

This example demonstrates the use of load balancing in tRPC.

## Usage

* Start the server
```shell
$ go run server/main.go -conf server/trpc_go.yaml
```

* Start the client
```shell
$ go run client/main.go
```

The server log will be displayed as follows:
```

## Explanation

When the service discovery returns a list of server addresses instead of a single address, it is necessary to use a load balancing algorithm to determine which address to communicate with the backend. This entire process is called load balancing, and tRPC-go currently uses client-side load balancing.

The tRPC-Go load balancing strategy defaults to a random strategy, Users can customize the load balancing algorithm. The algorithms provided by the framework include:

- random
- round robin
- weight round robin
- consistent hash

This demo uses a custom service discovery strategy, which can be referred to at [Discovery](/examples/features/discovery/README.md). In this example, testLB uses an assigned strategy with parameter `balancerName`.

There are two points to note:

- The service is addressed through the serviceName and target cannot be set. If target is set through client.WithTarget, tRPC-go will default to using the target for service discovery and load balancing. For example, if the target is set to "ip://127.0.0.1:8000", this will directly take the IP addressing strategy.
- It is necessary to import the corresponding load balancing strategy package, otherwise a "loadbalance not exists" error will be reported.
