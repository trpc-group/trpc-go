## tRPC-Go Hello World

This is a very simple example to run Hello World in tRPC-Go.

Run hello world server:
```bash
$ cd server && go run main.go
```

Start a new terminal to run hello world client:
```bash
$ cd client && go run main.go
```
You will see `Hello world!` displayed as a log.

Congratulations! You’ve just run a client-server application with tRPC-Go.
